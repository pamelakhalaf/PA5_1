### Problem Statement 
This exploratory analysis is aimed at predicting whether a driver receiving a coupon on his cellphone as he/she is driving through town will accept it or not. Various types of coupons are offered (e.g. bar, coffee house, restaurant, carry out & take away) under different driving conditions, weather conditions, time of the day and locations.  


### EDA 
The data comes from the UCI machine learning repository and was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The data consisted of 12684 entries for a total of 26 columns.  
The dataset does include missing values. In one instance, for the column "car", 99% of the column values was missing and the column was dropped. In other instances, < 2% of the dataset was missing and for those fields, we imputed with the most frequent value of that field. 
74 duplicates in the dataset were also dropped.
